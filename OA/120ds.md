# PREDICTIVE MODELING
### 2 What could be some issues if the distribution of the test data is significantly different than the distribution of the training data?
This is known as **dataset shift**, which could lead to inaccuracy of the model.

### 3 What are some ways I can make my model more robust to outliers?
- **Use a model that's resistant to outliers.** Tree-based models are not as affected by outliers, while regression-based models are. If we're performing a statistical test, try a non-parametric test instead of a parametric one.
- **Use a more robust error metric.** Switching from mean squared error to mean absolute difference (or Huber loss) reduces the influence of outliers.

Some changes we can make to the data:

- **Winsorize your data.** Artificially cap your data at some threshold.
- **Transform your data.** If your data has a very pronounced right tail, try a log transformation.
- **Remove the outliers.**
