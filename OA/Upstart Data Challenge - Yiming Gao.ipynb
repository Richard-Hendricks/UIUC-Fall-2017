    "# Problem Description\n",
    "In this problem, you will forecast the outcome of a portfolio of loans. Each loan is scheduled to be repaid over 3 years and is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "Each row corresponds to a loan, and the columns are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The column with header `days since origination` indicates the number of days that elapsed between origination and the date when the data was collected.\n",
    "- For loans that charged off before the data was collected, the column with header `days from origination to chargeoff` indicates the number of days that elapsed between origination and chargeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "We would like you to estimate **what fraction of these loans will have charged off by the time all of their 3-year terms are finished**."
